# Animal Image Classification with LDP Pipeline

(WIP)

This repository provides an end-to-end workflow for setting up a Lakeflow Declarative Pipeline (LDP) to perform batch inference on animal images stored in a Databricks Volume. The pipeline leverages distributed inference to automatically classify images using a deep learning model.
